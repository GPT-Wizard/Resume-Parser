# Building a Generative AI Application: Resume Parser üìùü§ñ

## Introduction üåü
> We will build a Generative AI application using a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse resumes. Leveraging our knowledge of LLMs and the technique of prompt engineering, we will develop a system that can extract and structure information from resumes, score them based on job descriptions, mask personal information, and generate interview questions.

## Problem Statement ‚ùì
> Objective: Create an application that parses uploaded resumes, extracts and structures the content, and provides additional functionalities to enhance the evaluation process.

## Functional Requirements
1. Resume Parsing
Task: The application should parse the content of an uploaded resume and output it in a well-formatted structured JSON format.
Output: Key-value pairs representing different sections of the resume (e.g., personal information, education, work experience, skills).
2. Resume Scoring
Task: The LLM should score the resume based on a provided job description.
Output: A score or rating indicating how well the resume matches the job description.
3. Personal Information Masking
Task: The application should identify and mask personal information such as name, email, phone number, and address in the resume.
Output: The structured JSON format should have masked values for personal information fields.
4. Question Generation
Task: Generate a set of interview questions based on the resume content.
Output: A list of questions tailored to the candidate's experience and skills.
