# Building a Generative AI Application: Resume Parser üìùü§ñ

## Introduction üåü
> We will build a Generative AI application using a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse resumes. Leveraging our knowledge of LLMs and the technique of prompt engineering, we will develop a system that can extract and structure information from resumes, score them based on job descriptions, mask personal information, and generate interview questions.

## Problem Statement ‚ùì
> Objective: Create an application that parses uploaded resumes, extracts and structures the content, and provides additional functionalities to enhance the evaluation process.
